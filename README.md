# University Programming Assignments - FEI STU ðŸ“šðŸ’»

## About this Repository ðŸ“–

Welcome to my collection of programming assignments completed during my studies at the **Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology (FEI)** at the **Slovak University of Technology (STU)**. This repository contains various solutions and exercises completed as part of the **Algorithmization and Programming** course. These tasks were performed during seminars and reflect the skills I have developed while learning and applying programming in the C language.

Each folder contains a separate assignment or project, with the code structured and commented to demonstrate the key concepts and solutions I have studied. The assignments range from simple algorithms to more complex problems, including file manipulations, logical operations, and various features of the C language.

## Contents ðŸ“‚

This repository includes:

- **Assignments**: Each assignment is organized in a separate folder by topic. Inside each folder, there are files containing source code and additional explanations in the comments.
- **Code**: The C code that solves each specific problem is written based on the principles learned in lectures and seminars.
- **Comments and Documentation**: Some comments and variable names are written in **Slovak**, as this is the language used in the course materials and lectures at the university.
